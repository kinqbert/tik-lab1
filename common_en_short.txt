Wonderful Nature
Nature is the source of life and harmony. Forests purify the air, oceans regulate the climate, and mountains, rivers, and deserts create unique ecosystems. At the same time, human activity threatens ecological balance. To preserve nature, we must care for it, reduce pollution, and conserve its resources. Nature is our shared home that needs protection.
